    question: "How long does a project take?",
    answer:
      "A focused landing page can launch in 2–3 weeks. Most custom websites range between 4–6 weeks depending on content, feedback speed, and integrations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with existing sites?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A refresh project starts with a quick audit to understand what stays, what changes, and where performance or UX can improve without a rebuild.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you need from me?",
    answer:
      "Brand assets, copy or outlines, access to any existing tools, and a primary point of contact. I provide a simple checklist so you always know what’s next.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we communicate?",
    answer:
      "You’ll get a shared timeline, weekly check-ins, and async updates. I keep feedback cycles structured to protect your time and momentum.",
  },
];
